# odd-even-jump

Concise abstract (only for my memorize, please check the link below if you want to know more): we have some array of integers, and we have to jump.

The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps.

We have to return the number of good starting indexes.

Input: `[10,13,12,14,15]`

Output: `2`
